I have created interface that imitates keypad that of Old Phones with number and
keys.

1.Basically we have 12 buttons with alphabet,numbers, or character.
2.if you click any key it will display chracter,numbers or alphabet according to timedelay.
3.if user pressed key for long time and time is greater then timedelay then print numeric value.
